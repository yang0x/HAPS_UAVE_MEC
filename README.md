# HAPS_UAVE_MEC
This project/library presents an experimental framework for HAPS-assisted MEC task offloading in wireless environments with potential malicious UAV eavesdroppers. Our proposed scheme jointly optimizes the secure transmission rate, computational frequency, task offloading ratio, and mobile positions of ICVs, aiming to minimize the overall system energy consumption, which includes energy expended by ICV mobility, task offloading (communication), and task computation. Additionally, we have provided code for other benchmark schemes (e.g., Local, HAPS, Random.).

The whole project is implemented with Python.

All code is placed in the experiments directory of this project.
